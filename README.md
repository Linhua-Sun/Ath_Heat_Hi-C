# Bioinformatic analysis code of Heat Stress Project
Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-Seq, WGBS, and Hi-C analysis in &lt;i>Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i>

## RNA-Seq (TE expression analysis)

## WGBS analysis (TE methylation analaysis)

## Hi-C analysis 

### Hi-C Seqencing data mapping and contact matrix construction
### Hi-C data visuzalition and IDE analysis
### KEE analysis
### Call HiC Significant interactions from Hi-C datasets (Fit-Hi-C)
1. fithic approach

2. Selfish

- How to downsample?
3. How to compare


### Compare Hi-C differential chromatin intertions (DCI) and TE expression.
